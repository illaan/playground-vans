# Vans Project

This project was created as part of a learning journey. I followed a tutorial on YouTube to develop this project. You can find the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/nDGA3km5He4?si=4gVx8UJWtBDmHWoL).

## Introduction

The "Vans" project is a React application aimed at learning React Router. It includes deep nested routes, protected routes, loaders, etc..

## Features

- Implementation of React Router for navigation.
- Pages: Home, About, and a protected page called Host.
- Integration with Python and Flask for the backend.

After cloning the repository, you'll need to navigate to the frontend and backend directories to install their respective dependencies and run the servers. Here's how to do it:

_Frontend Directory_:

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands to navigate to the frontend directory:
`cd rental`

3. **Install dependencies**

In the rental directory:
`npm install`

4. **Start the Servers**
